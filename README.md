# Design description

## Hardware

### MCU
The STM32L1 series features for this application relevant features like a large number of timers, specific low power modes, and an embedded EEPROM.

The MCU can be programmed and debugged via SWD accessable through a custom pin header, that also exposes the serial port.

### LED Driver
To drive a sufficient number of LEDs for edge illumination without efficiency reducing current balancing resistors, a LED driver with a step-up topology was selected. A two cell battery increases the efficiency of the step-up LED driver.

### RC5 receiver and sender

A IR emitting diode is driven by a small MOSFET from the PWM output of a timer in the MCU to send RC5 commands.

To receive RC5 commands the output of the IR receiver is sampled at a rate of about 4.5kHz by the MCU. The power supply of the IR receiver is cut in standby mode to prevent the battery to be drained prematurely.

### Brightness Sensor

The ambient brightness is sensed via an in expensive a broadly available phototransistor SFA 320. To enhance the dynamic range, the MCU can switch the bias current between two different levels.
The precision is fully sufficient to adjust the brightness of the power LEDs at power on and dim the status LED in standby.

### Battery Charger

The battery charger follows example application of the BQ2057 charging controller. The input voltage should be 9 V to avoid excessive power dissipation in the charging current regulating power transistor.
In newer hardware revision could switch off the charger during overvoltage conditions - However, the implementation in software is currently pending.
The status output is read by the MCU, that controls the status LED accordingly.
A temperature sensor is used to stop the charging if an overtemperature condition of the battery is detected.

## Software

TBA

## Known Limitations
- Very low power modes of MCU cannot be used, since to polarity of the encoder switch is not suitable.
- The MCU does not switch the battery charger off, if the input voltage would lead to a thermal overload of the charging transistor.
The batch of pcb made is missing the required hardware prerequisites. The latest version contains the required circuits, but has not been manufactured yet.
The batch is also missing the MOSFET to shutdown the battery temperature and external voltage measurement. Due to the high leakage current of the charging transistor, the battery is drained with about 400ÂµA also during power down.
- The ioc file currently targets the STM32L151 which is not available anymore. The setup can easily be changed to the STM32L151A.

# User Manual

The user interface is rather simplistic.

Turning the encoder increases or decreases the brightness.
The integrated push button is used to select functionality and change between on and off.
Detailed settings can be adjusted via the serial terminal.

Coming from standby a short button press switches the light on. A long button press activates the networked mode, where other compatible lighting appliances receive commands to follow on, off, and brightness settings.

When the appliance in on the short button press selects between the two individual LED strings and a mode where the brightness is modulated between the two channels.

When the button is pressed, the status led previews a for a short time the next selected functionality.



Standby can be reached via a long button pressed from power on mode.

| LED Color 	| Condition | Status   | 
| :------------ | :------ | :------- |
| red			|         | standby  |
| white			|         | power on |
| blue flashing |         | charging |
| green flash	| while adjusting brightness | maximum brightness reached |
| red flash		| while adjusting brightness | minimum brightness reached |
| white flash	| pressing the button short | selected first LED channel  |
| red flash		| pressing the button short | selected second LED channel |
| pink flash	| pressing the button short | selected mood light mode	      |
| blue flash	| pressing the button long to power off | duration of flash corresponds to the charging status of the battery |
| green flash	| pressing the button very long | cancel button pressed |

The white flash is actually not visible, since the LED is already shining white.
